# Google Developers: Data Preparation and Feature Engineering for Machine Learning

Machine learning helps us find patterns in dataâ€”patterns we then use to make predictions about new data points. To get those predictions right, we must construct the data set and transform the data correctly. This course covers these two key steps. We'll also see how training/serving considerations play into these steps.
